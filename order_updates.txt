The Order Updates Notification System in Zomato is a vital part of the app. 
It sends users notifications to keep them informed about their food orders. 
When a user places an order, they get an immediate confirmation. 
As the order progresses, the system sends updates on its preparation, cooking status, and when it's out for delivery. 
This real-time information allows users to track their orders, creating a smooth and interactive experience. 
Overall, this feature enhances user satisfaction and trust in the Zomato platform.
